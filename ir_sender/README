install pigpio
make sure pigpio daemon is off:
	sudo killall pigpiod

make all -> makes

1) nec  (brute force nec algorithm)
	usage: sudo ./nec
	time analysis mentioned later

2) light (turn on light)
	usage: sudo ./light
	an implementation of NEC. Address is "00000000" Command is "00000010"


nec brute force time analysis for Address: 00000000
and all 256 possible commands:
>>time sudo ./nec
real	1m21.196s
user	0m14.600s
sys	0m31.470s

Strategies to improve:

1) make queue of commands while commands are running using multithread
I think this is all that is necessary.
Theoretical time to brute force when fully optimized:
256*256*67.5 (size of address * size of command * time to send command in ms) 
= 4423.68 seconds = 73.728 minutes = 1.23 hours
